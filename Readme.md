***Hi! My name is Andrew!***

I present to you my own implementation of the test task. To start the work, run  [Start_SQL.sql](Start_SQL.sql). After creating the database, you can run the application.
                   
Start page: <http://localhost:8080/> (creating a vote with answer options.)

The page generated for the voter: <http://localhost:8080/creator-info/...> (only available from the link.)

The voting page for other people: <http://localhost:8080/add-likes/...> (This link allows people to vote, as well as go to the page and see the results)
                   
For options use the form for 5 options. To dynamically generate a form for the desired number of attempts to use JS but with it the application does not work correctly and had to stop on this option.
                   

As agreed the application works without registration of the voted user. Because of what one person can vote several times.

Have a nice day!
